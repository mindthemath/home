The goal is that anyone who wants to be able to take your raw data and reproduce all of the plots (and underlying statistical analyses being visualized) with the ease of issuing one command / clicking a single button in a web browser.\nReproducibility is a critical aspect to consider when conducting and sharing research. Not only does it strengthen the validity and credibility of findings, but it also facilitates revisiting and building upon work in the future.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that reproducibility encompasses not just sharing code, but also ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of methods and results. Adhering to best practices in reproducibility can enhance the reputation of researchers and bolster trust in their work.\nMotivations Why Care About Reproducibility? Reproducibility is critical for scientific credibility and the validity of research findings. When your work can be easily reproduced by others, it increases the trust and confidence in your results. Moreover, reproducibility is important for your own benefit as well. You never know when you\u0026rsquo;ll want to revisit your work in the future, or when you\u0026rsquo;ll need to build on it. When your work is easily reproducible, it will be much easier for you to pick up where you left off.\nBenefits for Your Future Self Research can be a challenging and time-consuming process, and one frustration researchers often encounter is not being able to easily find or recall the methods and data used to produce their results. By making your work reproducible, you can avoid this frustration and ensure a smooth experience when revisiting your work in the future.\nHaving a clear, concise, and easily accessible record of your methodology and data will save you time and effort. You won\u0026rsquo;t have to waste precious time retracing your steps or trying to figure out how you arrived at your results. This means that you can spend more time building upon your existing work and making new discoveries, rather than being bogged down by the tedious task of reconstructing your research.\nBy adopting best practices in reproducibility, you\u0026rsquo;ll also benefit your future self by fostering a sense of organization and structure in your research. This will make it easier for you to collaborate with others, share your work, and publish your findings, leading to a more impactful and successful research career.\nIn short, making your work reproducible will benefit both your current and future self, allowing you to focus on what truly matters - conducting groundbreaking research.\nApproaches to Reproducibility Even a simple, yet messy, approach to reproducibility is better than having no approach at all. As experience grows, participants may find that a structured approach to code that promotes flexibility and adaptability is even more advantageous, as it can facilitate collaboration and contribution from others, amplifying the impact of the work.\nIn this workshop, various approaches to reproducibility will be covered, from straightforward scripts to more structured and abstracted libraries and packages. The objective is to equip participants with the necessary information to make informed decisions about the best way to reproduce their research and to support them in making their work more accessible and impactful.\nThe workshop will provide participants with the tools and knowledge to make their research reproducible, including LaTeX documents and analysis code, allowing for easy verification and building upon by others.\nPresentation Structure Introduction: In this module, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss the motivations for making research reproducible, including how your \u0026ldquo;future self\u0026rdquo; will benefit, the importance of scientific credibility, and how reproducibility can save time.\nReproducing the PDF itself (going from images and LaTeX code to a publication-ready paper for submission to arxiv.org), complete with bibliography. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll cover what is involved with LaTeX reproducibility, and talk about tools like latexmake for automating the compilation, with the outcome of providing a docker container capable of taking the source code of the paper in the repo and producing a PDF.\nReproduction of the analyses and figures in the paper. This is about how we provide a reproducible compute environment (enabled by containerization technology, which we\u0026rsquo;ll overview in this section) capable of taking raw data and outputting all of the figures/tables required for inclusion in the final paper.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this workshop, participants will learn how to:\nUse LaTeX to produce professional-grade research papers, including formatting and bibliography. Automate the process of compiling their paper using tools like latexmake and leverage Makefile for describing dependencies in analyses. Think about how someone else will reproduce all the figures and tables in their paper from raw data. Create reproducible compute environments using containerization technology such as docker and share them (e.g., mybinder.org). Understand the importance of reproducibility in research, and the benefits of making their work easy to reproduce. Workshop Format Presentation: 90 minutes covering the lesson plan above Application: An optional 3-8 hour \u0026ldquo;office hours\u0026rdquo; style hands-on component where participants can practice what they\u0026rsquo;ve learned and receive help with reproducing their own research.

Metrics, such as distances, divergences, and similarity scores, are essential mathematical tools for this task. They allow us to define and measure how different two data sets are, or how well a model fits a given dataset.\nIn machine learning, metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of models, compare the accuracy of different algorithms, or to tune model parameters. But the same concepts and techniques are also useful in many other scientific disciplines, such as ecology, biology, physics, social sciences, and more.\nHowever, choosing the right metric for a specific task can be a challenging task, especially when multiple metrics are available, and it is not always obvious which one is the most appropriate for a given problem. Moreover, different metrics often have different properties and assumptions, and they can yield very different results depending on the data being analyzed.\nThe goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to the most commonly used metrics in scientific research and machine learning, and to provide them with a solid understanding of their mathematical properties, applications, and limitations. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to select, apply, and interpret different metrics to compare data sets, assess the quality of models, and solve a wide range of data analysis problems.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the mathematics behind distance calculations and formal metrics Compare and contrast common metrics used across scientific disciplines and machine learning applications Measure differences in distributions Relate different metrics to one another Apply these concepts to real-world data and research problems Workshop Format This workshop will consist of a mix of presentation materials and interactive coding examples that will give participants a chance to practice the concepts that we cover.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in variational approaches to PDEs, which are based on the minimization of certain functionals defined on spaces of functions. These techniques have many advantages, including a rigorous mathematical foundation, strong connections with optimization and machine learning, and the ability to tackle problems that are difficult or even impossible to solve with other methods. The purpose of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the theory of variational PDEs, with a focus on the practical aspects of solving and analyzing these equations using Python. Participants will learn how to formulate and solve several classic problems in mathematical physics, such as the heat, wave, and Laplace equations, using variational techniques. They will also learn how to use modern software tools such as FEniCS and Jupyter notebooks to implement and visualize the solutions. By the end of the workshop, participants should have a good understanding of the basic concepts and techniques of variational PDEs, as well as the confidence to apply them to their own research problems.\nLearning Outcomes Sobolev Spaces: A Fundamental Concept in PDEs One of the key concepts in understanding and solving partial differential equations is the idea of Sobolev spaces. Sobolev spaces are a type of function space that are used to study the regularity of solutions to PDEs. They are named after the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev, who introduced them in the 1930s.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of Sobolev spaces, including how they are defined, the different types of Sobolev spaces, and how they are used in the analysis of PDEs. We will also go over examples of PDEs and discuss how Sobolev spaces can be used to determine whether or not a solution exists and how smooth that solution is. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of Sobolev spaces and how they can be applied to the study of PDEs.\nBilinear Forms Bilinear forms are important in functional analysis, particularly in the study of partial differential equations. The reason for this is that they provide a way of defining function spaces such as Sobolev spaces, which are central to the analysis of PDEs. By defining a bilinear form on a space of functions, we can use it to define a norm on that space, which in turn allows us to measure the size of functions in the space.\nThis is particularly useful when studying PDEs, as it allows us to formulate weak solutions of the PDE in terms of the bilinear form. Sobolev spaces are a class of function spaces that are particularly well-suited to this approach, and are defined in terms of a particular bilinear form known as the Sobolev inner product. By using bilinear forms to define function spaces, we can apply tools from functional analysis to the study of PDEs, and use this to obtain information about the behavior of solutions to these equations.\nA bilinear form is a function $$B:H^1_0(\\Omega) \\times H^1_0(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$ that is linear in each of its arguments. For example, consider the following weak formulation of the heat equation:\n$$\\int_\\Omega u v_t + \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha u v = \\int_\\Omega f v$$ where \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are functions in the Sobolev space \\(H^1_0(\\Omega)\\) and \\(f\\) is a function. The left-hand side of this equation defines a bilinear form \\(B(u,v)\\). The first term in the integral is a linear form in \\(v\\), the second term is a bilinear form in \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), and the third term is a bilinear form in \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). The variational formulation of the heat equation can be derived by multiplying the PDE with a test function $v$ and integrating over the domain $\\Omega$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - \\nabla^2 u \u0026= f \u0026\\text{ in } (0,T)\\times \\Omega,\\\\ u \u0026= 0 \u0026\\text{ on } (0,T)\\times \\partial \\Omega,\\\\ u \u0026= g \u0026\\text{ at } t=0 \\text{ on } \\Omega. \\end{aligned} $$ $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^2 u v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx, $$ Using integration by parts, the second term can be written as $$ -\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^2 u v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} ds $$ where \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}\\) is the derivative of \\(u\\) normal to the boundary of the domain. Substituting this expression back in to the original equation and assuming that the boundary term vanishes due to the boundary conditions gives: $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx $$ The first term can be integrated by parts in time to yield: $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} dx - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} ds. $$ Substituting this expression back into the equation, we obtain the weak form of the heat equation, given by $$ \\int_{\\Omega} u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} dx + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx. $$ The bilinear form of the variational problem is given by: $$ a(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx $$ where \\(u,v\\) are functions in some suitable function space. FEniCS In this workshop, we will be using FEniCS, a popular open-source finite element software package, to solve various PDEs. FEniCS offers a modern C++/Python interface, automated code generation, and a range of finite element function spaces, providing a powerful and easy-to-use platform for implementing and solving PDE problems.\nWe will introduce the basic syntax and structure of FEniCS, along with its key features such as mesh generation, function space specification, and variational problem formulation. We will also demonstrate how FEniCS can be used to solve PDEs of various types, including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained a strong foundational knowledge of FEniCS, as well as the skills and tools to implement and solve PDE problems using this software.\nFEM Finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations. It works by dividing a complex problem into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements. Then, the differential equations are converted into algebraic equations that can be solved to find the approximate solution for each element. These solutions are then combined to obtain an overall solution for the entire problem. Finite element method is often used for solving partial differential equations because it allows for the approximation of solutions in a more efficient and accurate manner compared to traditional analytical methods. FEM is widely used in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics.\nFDM Finite difference methods are one approach to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), including variational PDEs. They approximate derivatives by finite differences and convert the differential equations into algebraic equations, which can be solved numerically using a computer.\nFinite difference methods are a popular numerical method for solving partial differential equations, particularly those that are defined over a discrete grid of points. The method relies on approximating the derivatives of the function at each point on the grid using finite difference quotients. By using this approximation, the original partial differential equation can be transformed into a system of linear equations that can be solved numerically. Finite difference methods have a long history in numerical analysis and are particularly useful for solving problems in areas such as physics, engineering, and finance. However, the accuracy of the method depends heavily on the choice of discretization scheme and the size of the grid used, and careful consideration is required to ensure that the method is both accurate and computationally efficient.\n","permalink":"http://mindthemath.com/workshops/pdes/","summary":"Motivations Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential tools for describing many natural phenomena, ranging from fluid dynamics to quantum mechanics.
