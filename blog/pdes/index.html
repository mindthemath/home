This workshop is not yet complete but please express interest in its development by reaching out.\nMotivations Partial differential equations (PDEs) are essential tools for describing many natural phenomena, ranging from fluid dynamics to quantum mechanics. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in variational approaches to PDEs, which are based on the minimization of certain functionals defined on spaces of functions.\nThese techniques have many advantages, including a rigorous mathematical foundation, strong connections with optimization and machine learning, and the ability to tackle problems that are difficult or even impossible to solve with other methods.\nThe purpose of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the theory of variational PDEs, with a focus on the practical aspects of solving and analyzing these equations using Python.\nParticipants will learn how to formulate and solve several classic problems in mathematical physics, such as the heat, wave, and Laplace equations, using variational techniques.\nThey will also learn how to use modern software tools such as FEniCS and Jupyter notebooks to implement and visualize the solutions. By the end of the workshop, participants should have a good understanding of the basic concepts and techniques of variational PDEs, as well as the confidence to apply them to their own research problems.\nLearning Outcomes Sobolev Spaces: A Fundamental Concept in PDEs One of the key concepts in understanding and solving partial differential equations is the idea of Sobolev spaces. Sobolev spaces are a type of function space that are used to study the regularity of solutions to PDEs. They are named after the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev, who introduced them in the 1930s.\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of Sobolev spaces, including how they are defined, the different types of Sobolev spaces, and how they are used in the analysis of PDEs.\nWe will also go over examples of PDEs and discuss how Sobolev spaces can be used to determine whether or not a solution exists and how smooth that solution is. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of Sobolev spaces and how they can be applied to the study of PDEs.\nBilinear Forms Bilinear forms are important in functional analysis, particularly in the study of partial differential equations. The reason for this is that they provide a way of defining function spaces such as Sobolev spaces, which are central to the analysis of PDEs.\nBy defining a bilinear form on a space of functions, we can use it to define a norm on that space, which in turn allows us to measure the size of functions in the space.\nThis is particularly useful when studying PDEs, as it allows us to formulate weak solutions of the PDE in terms of the bilinear form. Sobolev spaces are a class of function spaces that are particularly well-suited to this approach, and are defined in terms of a particular bilinear form known as the Sobolev inner product.\nBy using bilinear forms to define function spaces, we can apply tools from functional analysis to the study of PDEs, and use this to obtain information about the behavior of solutions to these equations.\nA bilinear form is a function $$B:H^1_0(\\Omega) \\times H^1_0(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$$ that is linear in each of its arguments. For example, consider the following weak formulation of the heat equation:\n$$\\int_\\Omega u v_t + \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\alpha u v = \\int_\\Omega f v$$ where \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are functions in the Sobolev space \\(H^1_0(\\Omega)\\) and \\(f\\) is a function. The left-hand side of this equation defines a bilinear form \\(B(u,v)\\). The first term in the integral is a linear form in \\(v\\), the second term is a bilinear form in \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), and the third term is a bilinear form in \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). The variational formulation of the heat equation can be derived by multiplying the PDE with a test function \\(v\\) and integrating over the domain \\(\\Omega\\): $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - \\nabla^2 u \u0026= f \u0026\\text{ in } (0,T)\\times \\Omega,\\\\ u \u0026= 0 \u0026\\text{ on } (0,T)\\times \\partial \\Omega,\\\\ u \u0026= g \u0026\\text{ at } t=0 \\text{ on } \\Omega. \\end{aligned} $$ $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^2 u v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx, $$ Using integration by parts, the second term can be written as $$ -\\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla^2 u v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} ds $$ where \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}\\) is the derivative of \\(u\\) normal to the boundary of the domain. Substituting this expression back in to the original equation and assuming that the boundary term vanishes due to the boundary conditions gives: $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx $$ The first term can be integrated by parts in time to yield: $$ \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} dx - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} ds. $$ Substituting this expression back into the equation, we obtain the weak form of the heat equation, given by $$ \\int_{\\Omega} u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} dx + \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx = \\int_{\\Omega} f v dx. $$ The bilinear form of the variational problem is given by: $$ a(u,v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v dx $$ where \\(u,v\\) are functions in some suitable function space. FEniCS In this workshop, we will be using FEniCS, a popular open-source finite element software package, to solve various PDEs. FEniCS offers a modern C++/Python interface, automated code generation, and a range of finite element function spaces, providing a powerful and easy-to-use platform for implementing and solving PDE problems.\nWe will introduce the basic syntax and structure of FEniCS, along with its key features such as mesh generation, function space specification, and variational problem formulation. We will also demonstrate how FEniCS can be used to solve PDEs of various types, including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained a strong foundational knowledge of FEniCS, as well as the skills and tools to implement and solve PDE problems using this software.\nFEM Finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to differential equations. It works by dividing a complex problem into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements. Then, the differential equations are converted into algebraic equations that can be solved to find the approximate solution for each element.These solutions are then combined to obtain an overall solution for the entire problem.\nThe finite element method is often used for solving partial differential equations because it allows for the approximation of solutions in a more efficient and accurate manner compared to traditional analytical methods. FEM is widely used in engineering, physics, and applied mathematics.\nFDM Finite difference methods are one approach to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), including variational PDEs. They approximate derivatives by finite differences and convert the differential equations into algebraic equations, which can be solved numerically using a computer.\nFinite difference methods are a popular numerical method for solving partial differential equations, particularly those that are defined over a discrete grid of points. The method relies on approximating the derivatives of the function at each point on the grid using finite difference quotients. By using this approximation, the original partial differential equation can be transformed into a system of linear equations that can be solved numerically.\nFinite difference methods have a long history in numerical analysis and are particularly useful for solving problems in areas such as physics, engineering, and finance. However, the accuracy of the method depends heavily on the choice of discretization scheme and the size of the grid used, and careful consideration is required to ensure that the method is both accurate and computationally efficient.\n","wordCount":"1335","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://mindthemath.com/blog/pdes/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mind the Math","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://cdn.mindthemath.com/logo.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://mindthemath.com/ accesskey=h title="MTM (Alt + H)">MTM</a>

For example, consider the following weak formulation of the heat equation:</p><p>$$\int_\Omega u v_t + \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - \int_{\partial \Omega} \alpha u v = \int_\Omega f v$$
where \(u\) and \(v\) are functions in the Sobolev space \(H^1_0(\Omega)\) and \(f\) is a function. The left-hand side of this equation defines a bilinear form \(B(u,v)\). The first term in the integral is a linear form in \(v\), the second term is a bilinear form in \(u\) and \(v\), and the third term is a bilinear form in \(u\) and \(v\).
The variational formulation of the heat equation can be derived by multiplying the PDE with a test function \(v\) and integrating over the domain \(\Omega\):
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \nabla^2 u &= f &\text{ in } (0,T)\times \Omega,\\
u &= 0 &\text{ on } (0,T)\times \partial \Omega,\\
u &= g &\text{ at } t=0 \text{ on } \Omega.
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} v dx - \int_{\Omega} \nabla^2 u v dx = \int_{\Omega} f v dx,
$$
Using integration by parts, the second term can be written as
$$
-\int_{\Omega} \nabla^2 u v dx = \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx - \int_{\partial \Omega} v \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} ds
$$
where \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\) is the derivative of \(u\) normal to the boundary of the domain.
Substituting this expression back in to the original equation and assuming that the boundary term vanishes due to the boundary conditions gives:
$$
\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} v dx + \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx = \int_{\Omega} f v dx
$$
The first term can be integrated by parts in time to yield:
$$
\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} v dx = \int_{\Omega} u \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} dx - \int_{\partial \Omega} v \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} ds.
$$
Substituting this expression back into the equation, we obtain the weak form of the heat equation, given by
$$
\int_{\Omega} u \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} dx + \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx = \int_{\Omega} f v dx.
$$
The bilinear form of the variational problem is given by:
$$
a(u,v) = \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \cdot \nabla v dx
$$
where \(u,v\) are functions in some suitable function space.</p><h3 id=fenics>FEniCS<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#fenics>#</a></h3><p>In this workshop, we will be using FEniCS, a popular open-source finite element software package, to solve various PDEs.

However, the accuracy of the method depends heavily on the choice of discretization scheme and the size of the grid used, and careful consideration is required to ensure that the method is both accurate and computationally efficient.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/mathematics/>mathematics</a></li><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/physics/>physics</a></li><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/numerical-methods/>numerical methods</a></li></ul><div class=share-buttons><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Variational PDEs on twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Variational%20PDEs&url=http%3a%2f%2fmindthemath.com%2fblog%2fpdes%2f&hashtags=mathematics%2cphysics%2cnumericalmethods"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM195.519 424.544c135.939.0 210.268-112.643 210.268-210.268.0-3.218.0-6.437-.153-9.502 14.406-10.421 26.973-23.448 36.935-38.314-13.18 5.824-27.433 9.809-42.452 11.648 15.326-9.196 26.973-23.602 32.49-40.92-14.252 8.429-30.038 14.56-46.896 17.931-13.487-14.406-32.644-23.295-53.946-23.295-40.767.0-73.87 33.104-73.87 73.87.0 5.824.613 11.494 1.992 16.858-61.456-3.065-115.862-32.49-152.337-77.241-6.284 10.881-9.962 23.601-9.962 37.088.0 25.594 13.027 48.276 32.95 61.456-12.107-.307-23.448-3.678-33.41-9.196v.92c0 35.862 25.441 65.594 59.311 72.49-6.13 1.686-12.72 2.606-19.464 2.606-4.751.0-9.348-.46-13.946-1.38 9.349 29.426 36.628 50.728 68.965 51.341-25.287 19.771-57.164 31.571-91.8 31.571-5.977.0-11.801-.306-17.625-1.073 32.337 21.15 71.264 33.41 112.95 33.41z"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Variational PDEs on linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fmindthemath.com%2fblog%2fpdes%2f&title=Variational%20PDEs&summary=Variational%20PDEs&source=http%3a%2f%2fmindthemath.com%2fblog%2fpdes%2f"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM160.461 423.278V197.561h-75.04v225.717h75.04zm270.539.0V293.839c0-69.333-37.018-101.586-86.381-101.586-39.804.0-57.634 21.891-67.617 37.266v-31.958h-75.021c.995 21.181.0 225.717.0 225.717h75.02V297.222c0-6.748.486-13.492 2.474-18.315 5.414-13.475 17.767-27.434 38.494-27.434 27.135.0 38.007 20.707 38.007 51.037v120.768H431zM123.448 88.722C97.774 88.722 81 105.601 81 127.724c0 21.658 16.264 39.002 41.455 39.002h.484c26.165.0 42.452-17.344 42.452-39.002-.485-22.092-16.241-38.954-41.943-39.002z"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share Variational PDEs on reddit" href="https://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3a%2f%2fmindthemath.com%2fblog%2fpdes%2f&title=Variational%20PDEs"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M449.446.0C483.971.0 512 28.03 512 62.554v386.892C512 483.97 483.97 512 449.446 512H62.554c-34.524.0-62.554-28.03-62.554-62.554V62.554c0-34.524 28.029-62.554 62.554-62.554h386.892zM446 265.638c0-22.964-18.616-41.58-41.58-41.58-11.211.0-21.361 4.457-28.841 11.666-28.424-20.508-67.586-33.757-111.204-35.278l18.941-89.121 61.884 13.157c.756 15.734 13.642 28.29 29.56 28.29 16.407.0 29.706-13.299 29.706-29.701.0-16.403-13.299-29.702-29.706-29.702-11.666.0-21.657 6.792-26.515 16.578l-69.105-14.69c-1.922-.418-3.939-.042-5.585 1.036-1.658 1.073-2.811 2.761-3.224 4.686l-21.152 99.438c-44.258 1.228-84.046 14.494-112.837 35.232-7.468-7.164-17.589-11.591-28.757-11.591-22.965.0-41.585 18.616-41.585 41.58.0 16.896 10.095 31.41 24.568 37.918-.639 4.135-.99 8.328-.99 12.576.0 63.977 74.469 115.836 166.33 115.836s166.334-51.859 166.334-115.836c0-4.218-.347-8.387-.977-12.493 14.564-6.47 24.735-21.034 24.735-38.001zM326.526 373.831c-20.27 20.241-59.115 21.816-70.534 21.816-11.428.0-50.277-1.575-70.522-21.82-3.007-3.008-3.007-7.882.0-10.889 3.003-2.999 7.882-3.003 10.885.0 12.777 12.781 40.11 17.317 59.637 17.317 19.522.0 46.86-4.536 59.657-17.321 3.016-2.999 7.886-2.995 10.885.008 3.008 3.011 3.003 7.882-.008 10.889zm-5.23-48.781c-16.373.0-29.701-13.324-29.701-29.698.0-16.381 13.328-29.714 29.701-29.714 16.378.0 29.706 13.333 29.706 29.714.0 16.374-13.328 29.698-29.706 29.698zM160.91 295.348c0-16.381 13.328-29.71 29.714-29.71 16.369.0 29.689 13.329 29.689 29.71.0 16.373-13.32 29.693-29.689 29.693-16.386.0-29.714-13.32-29.714-29.693z"/></svg></a></div></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy;
