# Workshop Structure

Our workshops are tailored to meet the needs of each audience, and we offer a flexible pricing model to accommodate your budget.

We offer three progressive workshop options:

**Learn** (60-90m): This foundation is a lecture-style presentation, followed by a Q&A session. For groups under 25 particpants, there is no additional charge.

**Practice** (Half-Day): In this option, we'll go through a hands-on practical component to help participants get a better understanding of the material. Cloud compute environments will be provided, participants need only to bring laptops with internet access.

**Perform** (3-Day): In this option, we'll apply what was learned in the practice workshop to your specific application domain.


# Pricing

| Option | Base Price | Per Participant |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Presentation + Q&A | $3,000 | N/A |
| Practice (Half-Day) | $2,500 | $500 |
| Perform (3-Day) | $10,000 | $1,500 |

We understand that travel expenses can be a consideration, so we'd be happy to discuss and include these in our final quote for your convenience. 

Please note that the prices can be adjusted based on the specific needs of your team or organization (e.g., bulk discounts, packaging with other services, etc).
If you have any questions or would like to discuss pricing further, please [contact us](/contact).
