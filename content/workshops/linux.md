## Overview
This workshop is designed to provide scientists and researchers from academia and industry with a comprehensive understanding of the basics of GNU+Linux.
participants will learn how to navigate both local and remote server environments, manipulate file outputs, and install software.
Additionally, participants will learn about the basic architecture of Linux/Unix, as well as how to recognize and work with other operating systems found on servers.


## Motivations
Comfort with "the Terminal" is an essential skill for conducting research in a range of scientific fields, and mastering it can help to streamline and speed up the research process.
Additionally, becoming proficient in GNU+Linux can open up new opportunities for collaboration and communication with other researchers, many of whom are likely already using Linux/Unix (i.e. MacOS), in their own work.

There are many tasks that can be easily automated through the combination of freely available tools (e.g., image-resizing and cropping), awareness is often the limiting factor.
Finally, working in the command-line can help participants to develop important technical skills that will be beneficial throughout their careers, and make them more marketable to potential employers.

## Learning Outcomes
At the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Navigate the command-line with confidence
- Manipulate file outputs using `sed`, `grep`, and `awk`
- Install software and understand the basic architecture of Linux/Unix
- Recognize and work with other operating systems found on servers
- Streamline their research and develop important technical skills

## Lesson Outline
1. Introduction to GNU+Linux and the command-line interface
2. Basic architecture of Linux/Unix, filesystems
3. Where to find pre-installed programs, what to expect on a fresh server
4. Navigating the filesystem with `cd`, `ls`
5. Reading, writing, and manipulating files
6. Installing software
7. Other operating systems found on servers

## Workshop Format
This workshop will be delivered through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and group discussions.
*Please note that this workshop has a minimum time format of 3 hours as it covers a lot of material.*

Participants will have access to a virtual machine with Linux already installed, so they can practice the skills they learn during the workshop.
By the end of the workshop, students will have a solid understanding of the basics of GNU+Linux, as well as the skills and confidence they need to navigate new computational resources for their research.
