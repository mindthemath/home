Welcome to Mind the Math, where innovation meets mathematics. 
We are a multidisciplinary consulting firm that specializes in connecting the latest research in academia with the practical application of software development. 
Our goal is to help teams achieve their outcomes more effectively and efficiently by leveraging the power of technology.

## Michael Pilosov, PhD

Mind the Math was founded by [Michael Pilosov](https://mpilosov.com/#who-i-am), a computational mathematician with a unique ability to bring together scientific and creative disciplines in real-world applications.
His background in _Uncertainty Quantification_ helped frame many practical engineering concerns (e.g. "how do we measure performance", "what data is useful?") when leading teams as a Machine Learning Architect to deliver predictive software for major technology companies.
He has a deep understanding of both worlds, and he is an expert communicator who can "code-switch" with ease between the academic and business communities.

## Services

We offer a range of services to help teams and organizations accelerate their progress between idea and outcomes. 
Our services include (but are not limited to):

- [Workshops](/workshops) on leveraging technology to be help you be more effective.
- Automation: have some manual process that you wish would just run itself? We can help.
- Training in the latest methods and techniques for data science and machine learning.
- Consulting on how to apply mathematics and software to achieve outcomes to real-world problems.
- Technical translation: Let us explain how some new development relates to your specific industry.

For more information on our services, please visit our [Service Offerings](/services) page. 


## Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice

Mathematics is the language of all other disciplines, and at Mind the Math, we believe in bridging the gap between theory and practice. 
By working with us, you benefit from Michael's ability to connect with academics and technologists to understand the latest research and integration with various tooling.

Let us leverage our expertise in mathematics, software development, and cloud computing to enable rapid iteration between hypotheses and outcomes.

Whether you're a researcher looking to advance your field, a data science shop seeking to scale workloads and automate processes, or a business looking to harness the power of an exciting new technology, Mind the Math can help. 

Let's explore the possibilities together and innovate at the speed of thought.
