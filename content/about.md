Welcome to Mind the Math, where innovation meets mathematics. 
We are a multidisciplinary consulting firm that specializes in connecting the latest research in academia with the practical application of software development. 
Our goal is to help teams achieve their outcomes more effectively and efficiently by leveraging the power of technology.

## Our Founder: Michael Pilosov, PhD

Mind the Math was founded by Michael Pilosov, a computational mathematician with a unique ability to bring together scientific and creative fields. 
With a background in applied mathematics and experience as a machine learning architect, Michael has the expertise to connect cutting-edge research with the latest software development practices. 
He has a deep understanding of both worlds, and he is a master communicator who can "code-switch" with ease between the academic and business communities.

## Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice

Mathematics is the language of all other disciplines, and at Mind the Math, we believe in bridging the gap between theory and practice. 
By working with us, you benefit from Michael's ability to connect with academics to understand the latest research, as well as his expertise in software development practices that enable rapid iteration between hypothesis and experimental results.
