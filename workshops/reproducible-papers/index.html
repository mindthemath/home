The goal is that anyone who wants to be able to take your raw data and reproduce all of the plots (and underlying statistical analyses being visualized) with the ease of issuing one command / clicking a single button in a web browser.\nReproducibility is a critical aspect to consider when conducting and sharing research. Not only does it strengthen the validity and credibility of findings, but it also facilitates revisiting and building upon work in the future.\nIt’s worth noting that reproducibility encompasses not just sharing code, but also ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of methods and results. Adhering to best practices in reproducibility can enhance the reputation of researchers and bolster trust in their work.\nMotivations Why Care About Reproducibility? Reproducibility is critical for scientific credibility and the validity of research findings. When your work can be easily reproduced by others, it increases the trust and confidence in your results. Moreover, reproducibility is important for your own benefit as well. You never know when you’ll want to revisit your work in the future, or when you’ll need to build on it. When your work is easily reproducible, it will be much easier for you to pick up where you left off.\nBenefits for Your Future Self Research can be a challenging and time-consuming process, and one frustration researchers often encounter is not being able to easily find or recall the methods and data used to produce their results. By making your work reproducible, you can avoid this frustration and ensure a smooth experience when revisiting your work in the future.\nHaving a clear, concise, and easily accessible record of your methodology and data will save you time and effort. You won’t have to waste precious time retracing your steps or trying to figure out how you arrived at your results. This means that you can spend more time building upon your existing work and making new discoveries, rather than being bogged down by the tedious task of reconstructing your research.\nBy adopting best practices in reproducibility, you’ll also benefit your future self by fostering a sense of organization and structure in your research. This will make it easier for you to collaborate with others, share your work, and publish your findings, leading to a more impactful and successful research career.\nIn short, making your work reproducible will benefit both your current and future self, allowing you to focus on what truly matters - conducting groundbreaking research.\nApproaches to Reproducibility Even a simple, yet messy, approach to reproducibility is better than having no approach at all. As experience grows, participants may find that a structured approach to code that promotes flexibility and adaptability is even more advantageous, as it can facilitate collaboration and contribution from others, amplifying the impact of the work.\nIn this workshop, various approaches to reproducibility will be covered, from straightforward scripts to more structured and abstracted libraries and packages. The objective is to equip participants with the necessary information to make informed decisions about the best way to reproduce their research and to support them in making their work more accessible and impactful.\nThe workshop will provide participants with the tools and knowledge to make their research reproducible, including LaTeX documents and analysis code, allowing for easy verification and building upon by others.\nPresentation Structure Introduction: In this module, we’ll discuss the motivations for making research reproducible, including how your “future self” will benefit, the importance of scientific credibility, and how reproducibility can save time.\nReproducing the PDF itself (going from images and LaTeX code to a publication-ready paper for submission to arxiv.org), complete with bibliography. Here we’ll cover what is involved with LaTeX reproducibility, and talk about tools like latexmake for automating the compilation, with the outcome of providing a docker container capable of taking the source code of the paper in the repo and producing a PDF.\nReproduction of the analyses and figures in the paper. This is about how we provide a reproducible compute environment (enabled by containerization technology, which we’ll overview in this section) capable of taking raw data and outputting all of the figures/tables required for inclusion in the final paper.\nLearning Outcomes By the end of this workshop, participants will learn how to:\nUse LaTeX to produce professional-grade research papers, including formatting and bibliography. Automate the process of compiling their paper using tools like latexmake and leverage Makefile for describing dependencies in analyses. Think about how someone else will reproduce all the figures and tables in their paper from raw data. Create reproducible compute environments using containerization technology such as docker and share them (e.g., mybinder.org). Understand the importance of reproducibility in research, and the benefits of making their work easy to reproduce. Workshop Format Presentation: 90 minutes covering the lesson plan above Application: An optional 3-8 hour “office hours” style hands-on component where participants can practice what they’ve learned and receive help with reproducing their own research. This section is limited to members of the same research groups/labs to tailor solutions to specific needs. now I want you to create an entire markdown file (in code block format) for a new lesson plan entitled “Version-Controlled Research” in which we’ll cover the basics of git, how it relates to git repository hosting services (such as bitbucket, github, or a self-hosted open-source solution like gitea (if one requires that level of isolation)), and how it can address some of the pain points in the research process. Namely, by using git to track changes to the code that either conducts your research (if working on computational methods) or performs some sort of statistical analysis, students and PIs alike stand to benefit from being able to review code changes, go back in time to “when it worked”, etc.\n","wordCount":"973","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://mindthemath.com/workshops/reproducible-papers/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mind the Math","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://mindthemath.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://mindthemath.com/ accesskey=h title="MTM (Alt + H)">MTM</a>

This section is limited to members of the same research groups/labs to tailor solutions to specific needs.</li></ol><p>now I want you to create an entire markdown file (in code block format) for a new lesson plan entitled &ldquo;Version-Controlled Research&rdquo; in which we&rsquo;ll cover the basics of git, how it relates to git repository hosting services (such as bitbucket, github, or a self-hosted open-source solution like gitea (if one requires that level of isolation)), and how it can address some of the pain points in the research process. Namely, by using git to track changes to the code that either conducts your research (if working on computational methods) or performs some sort of statistical analysis, students and PIs alike stand to benefit from being able to review code changes, go back in time to &ldquo;when it worked&rdquo;, etc.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/reproduciblility/>reproduciblility</a></li><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/research/>research</a></li><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/publications/>publications</a></li><li><a href=http://mindthemath.com/tags/science/>science</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=http://mindthemath.com/workshops/info/><span class=title>« Prev Page</span><br><span>General Information About Workshops</span></a>
